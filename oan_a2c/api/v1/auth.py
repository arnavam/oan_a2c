	#    already have an account, please log in") but it is also an oracle.
	#
	# Together they let one IP test 50 phone numbers a minute and learn, for each,
	# whether it belongs to a registered user. The same is true of the email branch
	# just below. Before production, decide whether the enumeration is acceptable for
	# this product (it may well be, for a phone-first flow in a known user base) and
	# if not, lower the per-IP cap and make both "already registered" responses
	# indistinguishable from a successful registration.
